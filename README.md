### Project Overview
The is a phase II clinical trial dataset for the new drug Auralin (hypothetical). The drug is undegoing trials and its performance is measured against the efficacy of the currently administered one - Novodra.  >Auralin is supposed to be the new orally administered insulin for diabetics. Novodra is based on the prevailinng syringe-injected cure already available.

>In this notbook, we will only be assessing the data for **quality** and **tidiness** and noting our observations. Following that, the data will be cleaned and explored for insights.
>
The dataset has three tables that will described in more detail below, to beter understand the terms and their implications

### Data Source
>This dataset is obtained from Udacity's data analysis course and was curated in close contanct with doctors to largely mimic a real trial dataset.

### Tools
- Python (Data Cleaning, Data Analysis and Data visualization)

### Data Cleaning
1. Assessing the Data
2. Handling missing value and Duplicate values
3. Handling correctness and Data Accuracy
4. Data cleaning and formatting

### Data Analysis

### Results 
- Concerning the treatment, we have more patients that uses Novodra to Auralin
- Novodra and Auralin has high side effect of hypoglycemia
- Novodra has high side effect of headache to Auralin
- Novodra has high side effect of injection site discomfort but Auralin has throat irritation

### Recommendation
- I will recommend Auralin treatment because of its reduced side effect compared to Novodra
